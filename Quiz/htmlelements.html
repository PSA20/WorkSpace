        Engineering is the use of scientific principles to design and build
        machines, structures, and other items, including bridges, tunnels,
        roads, vehicles, and buildings.[1] The discipline of engineering
        encompasses a broad range of more specialized fields of engineering,
        each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied
        mathematics, applied science, and types of application. See glossary of
        engineering.
      </p>

      <p>
        The term engineering is derived from the Latin ingenium, meaning
        "cleverness" and ingeniare, meaning "to contrive, devise".[2]
      </p>

      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>
        The American Engineers' Council for Professional Development (ECPD, the
        predecessor of ABET)[3] has defined "engineering" as:
      </p>

      <p>
        The creative application of scientific principles to design or develop
        structures, machines, apparatus, or manufacturing processes, or works
        utilizing them singly or in combination; or to construct or operate the
        same with full cognizance of their design; or to forecast their behavior
        under specific operating conditions; all as respects an intended
        function, economics of operation and safety to life and property.[4][5]

        <h3>History</h3>

        <p>
          Engineering has existed since ancient times, when humans devised
          inventions such as the wedge, lever, wheel and pulley, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          The term engineering is derived from the word engineer, which itself
          dates back to the 14th century when an engine'er (literally, one who
          builds or operates a siege engine) referred to "a constructor of
          military engines"<sup
            ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering"> [6]</a></sup
          >
          In this context, now obsolete, an "engine" referred to a military
          machine, i.e., a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a
          catapult). Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived
          to the present day are military engineering corps, e.g., the U.S. Army
          Corps of Engineers.
        </p>
      </section>
      <p>
        The word "engine" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving
        from the Latin ingenium (c. 1250), meaning "innate quality,<br />
        especially mental power, hence a clever invention."[7]
